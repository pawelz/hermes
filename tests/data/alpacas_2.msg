Subject: Urgent: The invisible llama has breached containment

Sir/Madam,

This is an urgent notification. Subject L-001, the entity we have been referring to as "the invisible llama," has escaped its chroniton-fenced paddock.

We believe it has folded spacetime to attend what it communicated via telepathic humming as "a very important tea party." We cannot determine if this event is in the past, present, or future. The last known trace of its existence was a faint scent of ozone and a half-eaten scone that materialized on my desk.

If you observe reality warping slightly, or if you find that your teacups are suddenly filled with Earl Grey and existential dread, please do not approach the anomaly. We are attempting to lure it back with a bucket of crystallized moonlight, its preferred snack.

Awaiting your guidance,
Dr. Aris Thorne
