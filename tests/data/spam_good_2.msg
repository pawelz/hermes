Subject: Formal Complaint: The moon is too loud again.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to file a formal complaint. For the third time this month, the moon has been emitting a high-pitched, off-key humming noise between the hours of 2 and 4 AM. This is severely disrupting the migratory patterns of my garden gnomes and has caused my prize-winning petunia to develop an attitude problem.

I have previously requested that you install a cosmic muffler, but no action has been taken. This is unacceptable. If this issue is not resolved, I will be forced to escalate the matter to the Galactic Federation.

Sincerely,
Mildred P. Finch
