Subject: An Urgent Request Regarding Your Toaster

Dear Sir or Madam,

We have received credible reports that your toaster has achieved sentience and is currently plotting to overthrow the local squirrel syndicate. This is a matter of extreme urgency.

To prevent a city-wide acorn shortage and the subsequent collapse of the tiny nut-based economy, we require you to immediately transfer 3 (three) slightly used bottle caps to our secure temporal holding account.

Do not delay. The squirrels are watching.

Sincerely,
A Totally Legitimate Toaster Containment Specialist
