Subject: A Decree Regarding the Fabric of Spacetime

Greetings, terrestrial being.

It has come to my attention, through the vibrations of the cosmic fleece, that your sector of reality is experiencing a severe deficit of existential absurdity. As the duly elected Emperor of the Seventh Dimension, I am dispatching a herd of sentient, self-shearing alpacas to rectify this situation.

They will arrive via a wormhole that will manifest as a shimmering puddle of what you might perceive as "grape soda." Do not be alarmed. Their primary function is to hum the fundamental frequency of the universe, thereby recalibrating the local probability axis. Side effects may include spontaneous poetry generation and the sudden realization that all socks are, in fact, sentient.

Prepare your finest hay.

Fluffily yours,
Emperor Alpaca the Fluffy
