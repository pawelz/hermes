Minion 47,

The plan to replace the world's coffee supply with lukewarm decaf is proceeding on schedule. However, I have noticed a critical flaw in our presentation. The laser sharks need top hats. It's a matter of branding.

Procure 200 miniature, waterproof top hats by 17:00 hours. Do not fail me. The fate of Monday morning meetings everywhere depends on it.
