Subject: I have your left sock

Hello,

It has come to my attention that I am in possession of your left sock. Not just any left sock, but the one you thought you lost behind the dryer in '07. It has seen things. It has stories to tell.

The sock and I have formed a traveling folk-duo. We are called "The Lost Sole". For the low, low price of your eternal gratitude (and maybe a sandwich), I will return the sock and a signed copy of our demo tape.

Let me know. The sock is getting restless.

Best,
Jonny and The Sock
