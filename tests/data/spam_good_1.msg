Subject: Regarding Your Annual Solstice Quota

Dear Mortimer,

This is a friendly, festive reminder that your annual quota of existential dread is due by the next solstice. We have noted a significant surplus of joy in your sector, which is destabilizing the melancholy markets.

Please ensure you spend at least one evening contemplating the infinite void while listening to whale songs played in reverse. Failure to comply will result in a mandatory visit from the Cheerful Gnomes of Accountability.

Warmly (but not too warmly),
The Grand Arbiter
